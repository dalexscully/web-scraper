# Web Scraping

<hr

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Scrape a Wikipedia page and record which passages need citations.

  - E.g. History of Mexico has a few " citations needed".
- Your web scraper should report the number of citations needed.
- Your web scraper should identify those cases AND include the relevant passage.

  - E.g. Citation needed for "lorem spam and impsum eggs"
  - Consider the 'relevant passage' to be the parent element that contains the passage, often a paragraph element.

Implementation Notes

- Count function must be named get_citations_needed_count

- Report function must be named get_citations_needed_report

  - get_citations_needed_report takes in a url returns a string
  - the string should be formatted with each citation needed on own line, in order found.
